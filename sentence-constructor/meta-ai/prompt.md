 Let's start transcribing the sentence into Hindi. Here's a clue to get you started:
"Bears" can be translated to "भालू" (Bhalu) in Hindi.

Now, can you think of a word that means "are" in Hindi? Here's a hint: it's a verb that is commonly used in day-to-day conversations.

Also, I'll provide you with a vocabulary table that you can use as a reference:

| Word    | Hindi Translation     | Part of Speech |
|---------|---------------------- |---------------|
| Bear    | भालू (Bhalu)           | Noun          |
| Door    | दरवाजा (Darwaza)      | Noun          |
| Garbage | कूड़ा (Kooda)          | Noun          |
| Leave   | छोड़ना (Chhodna)       | Verb          |
| Out     | बाहर (Bahar)          | Adverb        |

Remember, I'll guide you through the transcription process, but I won't provide the final answer. You'll have to work through it with my clues and hints!

Sure! Let's work through this step by step.  

### Vocabulary Table  

| **English** | **Hindi** | **Type** |  
|------------|-----------|----------|  
| Bear       | भालू       | Noun     |  
| Door       | दरवाज़ा   | Noun     |  
| Garbage    | कचरा     | Noun     |  
| Leave      | छोड़ना   | Verb     |  
| Out        | बाहर     | Adverb   |  

### Step-by-Step Clues  

1. **"Bears are at the door"**  
   - "Bears" = **भालू**  
   - "Door" = **दरवाज़ा**  
   - "Are at" → This means **they are positioned near or at the door**. How do you express "at" in Hindi?  
   - Think about forming a simple sentence: "**भालू ____ दरवाज़े पर हैं।**" (Fill in the blank!)  

2. **"Did you leave the garbage out?"**  
   - "Leave" = **छोड़ना**  
   - "Garbage" = **कचरा**  
   - "Out" = **बाहर**  
   - "Did you leave" → This is a past action, how do we phrase it in Hindi? Think about using **"क्या तुमने"** at the beginning.  
   - Try forming it: "**क्या तुमने कचरा ____ छोड़ दिया?**" (Fill in the blank!)
